Physician employment contract data model

This data model provides a comprehensive overview of important contractual details for physician agreements. The information modeled here is meant to provide physicians with a useful resource for understanding and negotiating their contracts. The data model is organized into sections that model information relevant to the term of the contract, indemnity provisions, call coverage, benefits, responsibilities, compensation, time off, recourse, and optional fields

The mandatory fields within the data model are organized by type. For example, the term section requires data about the start date, end date, and whether or  not it is eligible for extension. Similarly, the indemnity provisions require data about tail coverage, severance clause, and non-compete.

Optional fields are also included and provide physicians with a way to add more granular details to the agreement. For example, a physician may choose to add details about the specialty, practice setting, geographic area, location, and concierge requirements to the contract.

This data model is built with a focus on physicians and other similar medical professionals. It is meant to provide them with comprehensive information  about the contract so that they can confidently enter into and benefit from it.
