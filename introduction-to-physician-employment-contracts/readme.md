# ðŸ“‹ Physician Employment Contract Data Model

Physician employment contracts can be complex and difficult to navigate. This project aims to simplify the process by providing a standardized data model and a user-friendly web application that allows physicians to easily compare various contracts and negotiate better terms. With the help of AI-powered contract analysis, physicians can focus on their career goals and personal preferences while making informed decisions. This repository contains the physician employment contract data model, designed to support side-by-side comparisons and contract negotiation assistance for physicians.

This will be used to power Andwise's [physician employment contract analyzer.](https://blog.joinandwise.com/?p=contract-analyzer)

## Data Model Structure

The data model consists of the following elements:

* Employment contract attributes (e.g., salary, benefits, work hours)
* Contract provisions (e.g., non-compete clause, termination provisions)

The data model is designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to accommodate changes in contract formats and industry standards.

## Next Steps

1. An AI-powered contract analysis tool that extracts key data points from contracts
2. A web application that enables physicians to upload, view, and compare contracts
3. Advanced search and filtering capabilities within the web application
4. A contract negotiation support feature providing personalized recommendations
