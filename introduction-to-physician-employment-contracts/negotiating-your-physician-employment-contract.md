### Preparing for Negotiation

* **Understand Your Priorities**: Know what is most important to you in a contract. This could be salary, work hours, or flexibility for other pursuits.
* **Research Market Rates**: Understand the typical compensation for your role in your geographic area. This will help you know if an offer is fair.

### During Negotiation

* **Communicate Your Needs**: Be clear about what you want from the contract. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want.
* **Be Willing to Compromise**: Negotiation is a two-way street. Be prepared to make concessions to reach an agreement.

### After Negotiation

* **Review the Final Contract**: Make sure all agreed-upon changes have been made. Don't rush to sign the contract. Take your time to review it thoroughly.
