### Identifying a Dispute

* **Understand the Nature of the Dispute**: Is it a misunderstanding, a breach of contract, or a legal issue? Identifying the nature of the dispute will help you determine the best course of action.

### Resolving a Dispute

* **Communication and Negotiation**: Try to resolve the dispute amicably through communication and negotiation. This is often the fastest and least expensive way to resolve a dispute.
* **Mediation or Arbitration**: If communication and negotiation fail, consider mediation or arbitration. These are formal processes that can help resolve disputes without going to court.

### Legal Action

* **Consult with a Legal Professional**: If all else fails, you may need to take legal action. Consult with a legal professional to understand your options.
